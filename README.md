Welcome To My Portfolio
My name is Carlos and I am a FullStack Website Developer. Outside of coding, I enjoy living an active and healthy lifestyle, through travelling, running, bikng, and other outdoor and physical activites.

I developed this website using React and Node.js, on the Next.JS framework. And I created a simple Node.JS Express API communicating with MySQL, where these blog posts are stored.

I plan to showcase projects I developed during my career as a FullStack Website Developer, in addition to personal projects, including the code for this blog.

I also post about the various adventures I've been on, from international vacations to a 50 mile Ultra Marathon.
